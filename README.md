# alcrsa

A "for fun" implementation of the RSA cryptography algorithm, from scratch, with
C. This project investigates the use and theory of arbitrarily large integers
and its arithmetic operations, as well as mathematical algorithms detailing
mechanisms behind prime tests and pseudo-random number generation. It obviously
also does observe RSA's operation and potential security vulnerabilities.

Currently a **WIP** side project to practice writing quality code for complex
problems and to kill some time :-).

## Installation

1. Get source files with `git clone https://github.com/alvchan/rsa-c`.
2. Enter src directory - `cd rsa-c/src`.
3. Run `make` to build from source.
