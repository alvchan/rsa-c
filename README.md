# alcrsa

A "for fun" implementation of the RSA cryptography algorithm, from scratch, with
C. Currently a **WIP** side project to practice writing quality code for complex
problems and to kill some time :-).

## Installation

1. Get source files with `git clone https://github.com/alvchan/rsa-c`.
2. Enter src directory - `cd rsa-c/src`.
3. Run `make` to build from source.
